## Web Page Project README

This project involves implementing a fully functional web page based on the design provided by UI/UX designer Nicolas Philippot. The web page will be created from scratch, without using any external CSS framework or JavaScript. The project consists of multiple tasks, and the focus will be on using HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design techniques to achieve the desired results.

## Task 0: Familiarize with Figma

To begin, create an account in Figma and access the project provided by Nicolas Philippot. Duplicate the project to your drafts to have access to all design details. If you encounter any missing fonts on your computer, you can find them in the links provided: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT.

Interactions Note:

The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
Links hover/active: #FF6565
Button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
Max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

## Task 1: Header

Build the header/hero section of the web page. Remember to:

Use CSS reset for styling.
Utilize variables and generic CSS selectors.
Keep the HTML structure simple with the help of div containers.
Start building the web page from the outside to the inside and from top to bottom.

## Task 2: "What we do..." Section

Copy files from the previous task (header). In this section, you will need to use custom font icons provided in the holberton_school-icon.zip archive. Try to build this section as generic as possible, as you may need some components in the next section.

## Task 3: "Our Results" Section

Copy files from the previous task (What we do... section). Reuse components from the previous task to create the "Our Results" section.

## Task 4: Contact Us Section

Copy files from the previous task (Our Results section). Add a contact form to the landing page. Feel free to include animations and constraints on form fields.

## Task 5: Footer

Copy files from the previous task (Contact Us section). Create the footer section to complete the web page.

Remember to maintain the design consistency, responsiveness, and accessibility throughout the entire implementation.

Feel free to implement the web page in any order you prefer, but make sure to structure the components properly to avoid getting lost with HTML tags.

Once you complete the project, you should have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the provided design file.

Happy coding!
